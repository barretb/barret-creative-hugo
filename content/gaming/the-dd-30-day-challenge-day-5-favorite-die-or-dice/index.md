By far my favorites are my newest set of dice, the Q-Workshop Pathfinder Metal Dice set from their recent [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/q-workshop/pathfinder-and-q-workshop-metal-rpg-dice-set). I got the silver dice and they are amazing. Well weighted and balanced, beautiful, smooth rolling and they make a great sound rolling into the dice tray. My only minor quibble is that they are sometimes hard to read. The numbers are small, so it can sometimes be difficult to tell if it rolled a 6, a 9 or a P (They replace the top number on each die with the Pathfinder P symbol. i.e. on a d20, P means 20, on a d8 it means 8, etc).

They will be my go-to dice set for the foreseeable future.
