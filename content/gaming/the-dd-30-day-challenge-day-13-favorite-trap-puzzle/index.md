What’s the best way to put this? I HATE TRAPS AND PUZZLES! There, I said it and I won’t take it back. There is not one single, solitary trap or puzzle I’ve enjoyed or liked as a player. None, whatsoever. Whenever I encounter a trap or puzzle as a PC, I let the other PCs take care of it if possible and will only involve myself if I have to. Even when I play a rogue, I’ll let the others deal with puzzles and I’ll take traps.

As a DM, I understand that they are often necessary and will include them when I need to, but generally just the minimum effort (i.e. module as written for traps & puzzles, no additions or creativity usually).
