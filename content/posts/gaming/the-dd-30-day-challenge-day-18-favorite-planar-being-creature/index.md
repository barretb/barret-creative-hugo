This covers a wide band of creatures, so it’s hard to pick. I mean you’ve got celestials, formians, demons, devils, eladrin, djinni, mephits, nightmares, tieflings, slaads, and many, many more. How can anyone pick from among those? Let’s just pick one at random and say hell-hound. Here, doggy, doggy, doggy! Good dog! Uh, I mean, bad dog! OW! Stop biting me! Run!!!
