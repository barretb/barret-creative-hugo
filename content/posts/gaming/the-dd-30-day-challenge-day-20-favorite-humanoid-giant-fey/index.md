Fey annoy the crap out of me. Stupid tree-huggers. :)

Of these, my favorites are the fire giants. Tough, smart and not taking any crap from anyone. This goes back to the original 1st ed. G-series modules “Against the Giants” (G1, G2, G3). These were fantastic modules that ended in the “Hall of the Fire Giant King”. I loved that module. I thought it was a blast and have had an appreciate for the fire giants as foes ever since. I don’t think I’ve ever had an encounter with fire giants that ever left my party unscathed.
