Well, as with most things game related this has a complex answer. While we have played in a mostly Forgotten Realms world, it is a home-brew version where pretty much any deity was acceptable. As such, of the divine based characters I have played, 2 were clerics of Pelor, a Greyhawk deity, 1 was a paladin of Helm, a Forgotten Realms deity, 1 was a cleric of Heironeous, another deity of Greyhawk, and one was a cleric of Occipitus, not a deity at all really, but a plane of existence that kind of sits on the Abyssal range. However, it was formed from a fallen part of the Celestial planes, so it’s kind of lost in between. Now that we are playing in Golarion, my current cleric is of Ra, an ancient god of Osirion.

I enjoyed them all to an extent, but the one I had the most fun with was the cleric of Occipitus. He’s the same character that started out as a bard and was “converted”. If you’ve ever played the Shackled City campaign, you probably know about the plane of Occipitus and the Smoke-Eye. Aeduin took upon himself the guardianship of that plane and became its cleric, replacing one of his eyes with a smoking eye. It ended up being a lot of fun.
