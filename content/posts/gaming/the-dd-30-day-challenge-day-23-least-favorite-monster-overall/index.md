Gnoll rangers. It’s a funny story. Well, OK, it wasn’t all that funny. You had to be there. Suffice it to say if the rest of your party is trapped behind an iron grate, don’t wander off to scout the area while they’re working to get through to your side. Just don’t do it. Don’t. Even if you’re a one-armed paladin. Just don’t.
