I am perhaps overly fond of cursed items. As a DM, anyway. I find them amusing and when I DM, I have thrown quite a few of them at my adventurers. It’s never powerful cursed items, just little things that will cause mischief or annoy. My favorite, however, has to be the infamous Belt of Gender Change. Few things more hilarious than a party member that suddenly finds themselves of a different gender.
