Love the shield guardians. Delban had one for a while and it came in quite handy for saving his life multiple times. I also am fascinated by the more unusual golems. For instance, in 3e there was a stained glass golem that was pretty cool and Pathfinder has added a few like crystal golems and gelatenous golems that are also pretty cool.
