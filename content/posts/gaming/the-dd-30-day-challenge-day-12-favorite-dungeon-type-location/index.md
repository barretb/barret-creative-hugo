My favorite dungeon types are old school dungeon crawls. Just a place underground with a bunch of levels and a bunch of halls and rooms on each level. First adventure I played was [The Keep on the Borderlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keep_on_the_Borderlands). That style has always been my favorite. Castles, citadels, towers, cities, sewers, forests and whatever else take second place to the old school dungeon crawl.
