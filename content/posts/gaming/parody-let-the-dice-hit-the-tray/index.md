I wrote this parody song a few months ago and only posted it to Twitter. Thought I'd add it here now as well. Sung to the tune of Drowning Pool's "Let The Bodies Hit The Floor".  All due apologies to [Drowning Pool](http://drowningpool.com/), [Paizo](https://paizo.com/pathfinder/rpg) and [Wizards of the Coast](http://dnd.wizards.com/).

Original Song - Let the Bodies Hit the Floor by Drowning Pool

A**_nd now, my lyrics....._**

Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the traaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!!

Hit points drop off (drop off)  
Potion must quaff  
(Here we go, here we go, here we go)

One, cleric come heal me  
Two, cleric come heal me  
Three, cleric come heal me  
Four, cleric come heal me

One, come on, roll 20  
Two, come on, roll 20  
Three, come on, roll 20    
Noooooooww!!!!

Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the traaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!!

Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the traaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!

Bard sings again (again)  
Chased by gob-lin  
(Here we go, here we go, here we go)

One, cleric come heal me  
Two, cleric come heal me  
Three, cleric come heal me  
Four, cleric come heal me

One, come on, roll 20  
Two, come on, roll 20  
Three, come on, roll 20  
Nooooow!!

Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the traaaaaaaaaaaaay!!

Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the tray

Zombies and wights, skeleton  
The wizard's last spell, but then he's all done  
Your rogue got you in and now you're here  
You failed your save, so run in fear

Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the traaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!!!!!

One, cleric come heal me  
Two, cleric come heal me  
Three, cleric come heal me  
Four, cleric come heal me

One, come on, roll 20  
Two, come on, roll 20  
Three, come on, roll 20 Noooooooooow!!

Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the tray!

Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the tray  
Let the dice hit the tray

Heeeey!!!! Roll!!  
Heeeey!!!! Roll!!  
Heeeey!!!! Roll!!  
Heeeey!!!! Roll!!  
Heeeey!!!! Roll!!
