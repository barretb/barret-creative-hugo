Check out my latest story, [“The Fall of Silverstar“](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/aeleon-delban/a/the-fall-of-silverstar-article). It’s set in the world of Aeleon that I’ve been working on. It’s the last days of a once mighty civilization of elves that was falling to their own pride and arrogance.
